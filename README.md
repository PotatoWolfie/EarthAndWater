# [BIG IMAGE OF EVERYTHING IN MOD]
Earth & Water is a mod that expands on elemental mobs. Minecraft has the Blaze and Breeze, which fills in half the elemental mobs. E&W adds the other two elemental mobs, the Bore and Brine! These two mobs come with their own blocks and structures that fit them respectively.

Think Blaze or Breeze.. but Earth. The bore is a protective mob who wants you away from it. Bores spawn in Ancient Ruins. If one catches you spelunking in its territory, it'll shoot out a Earth Charge at you. These Earth Charges fracture on impact and hurt, a lot. If you get too close, it'll try burrowing in the ground to get away. You can of course dig it up with a pickaxe if you catch up to it.

# ![Brine Idle Animation](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/4af28b442fcf93dca12e35d668fc4d61257975f5.gif) Brine
The other Blaze/Breeze type mob. The Brine lurks in the depths of the ocean in the Conduit Monument. They dash through water to get around, and are quite fast. It shoots out a Water Charge, which in short is a sticky bomb. Stays where it was thrown for two seconds, then blows up. Brines are friend of the Conduit, for the Conduit doesn't try hurting it.
